		<p>Here are some tips that you need to know before you start to bake!</p>

		<h2>Measure Properly</h2>
		<p>This is one of the most important rules in baking. Use the spoon and level method for dry ingredients: spoon the ingredients into a dry measuring cup and level the top with a straight edge. Do not pack it in&comma; you’ll end up with way too much that you should. The only ingredient that you should ever pack into a cup is brown sugar. Liquid ingredients are more straightforward&comma; always measure them in a clear measuring cup on a stable and flat surface.</p>

		<h2>Use Room Temperature Ingredients</h2>
		<p>It’s important to follow through when a recipe asks for room temperature ingredients. It’s best to leave ingredients overnight&comma; but there are ways to get around this: For eggs&comma; one could place them in a bowl and run them under warm tap water for a few minutes. For butter&comma; one could microwave it.</p>

		<h2>Don&rsquo;t Make Substitutions</h2>
		<p>There really aren’t many good substitutes for all-purpose flour&comma; sugar&comma; butter or eggs. Experiment at your own risk.</p>

		<h2>Don&rsquo;t Overmix</h2>
		<p>Mixing causes the result to have a chewy texture&comma; which is something that we don’t want in cakes and muffins. When a recipe says so&comma; make sure to not overmix and just go until it is uniform.</p>
